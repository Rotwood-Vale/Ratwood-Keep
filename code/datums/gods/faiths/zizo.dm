		A long time ago, Zizo achieved the impossible: she vanquished Psydon and took His place. \
		The feeble minded cling to the so-called Successors and the forsaken Inhumen, some even claim Psydon still lives!\n\
		The godhead smiles upon us as we defile Psydon's creation and become the divinities we were always meant to be."
