		"...a barkeep whistles as he cleans glasses and a drunkard snores, passed out on the counter. The rest of the tavern focuses on you with bated breath as your dagger darts between your fingers in an impressive display of legerdemain...",
		"...a flash of steel through the sky, and another, and another. Blades pass between your juggling hands as if you were pulling on singular, thick rope...",

		"...a shining length of ivory steel. A token. A symbol. More than just a weapon. Blood runs thick in the wash-bin. Sparks fly from the grindstone. You maintain the blade and it maintains your honour...",
		"...the rapier dances in your hand, a whisper of steel cutting through the air. Every thrust is precise, every parry and riposte flowing in perfect rhythm, simply awaiting the moment to seal your their fate with a single, fatal strike..."

	"...'I am ineffable. I am unpierceable.' The wicked white guardian says. And so, you shatter its skull in a single blow with your mace, for it was not unbludgeonable...",
	"...the air trembles with each of your mighty blows, each strike echoing like the final toll of a bell. This is your symphony. Revel in its brutal beauty, its crushing simplicity...",

	"...stuck in the flesh, you rip away at your weapon. It comes loose. Blood splatters across your armor and cloak and the side of your face. Hunting is no easy job, but the old man's teachings are effective...",
	"...your axe descends, and another tree falls. Wet sap runs down your face as you hack and chop relentlessly turning the forest into a thicket, then the thicket until it is an open plains. It's only when you pause and look down that you see the shattered bones, the torn flesh and the mangled faces. The town square has turned crimson, drenched in the aftermath of your fury...",
	"...the heft of iron pulls upon your arm. It knows where it wishes to be - all you have to do is guide its fall. Knowing this, your axe feels lighter than you remember...",
	"...despite the insurmountable challenge, you fear nothing, for the axe is thy companion eternal. Problem solving is quite simple, really..."
