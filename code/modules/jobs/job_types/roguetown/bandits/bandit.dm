/*BANDIT DESIGN GOALS:

Minor antagonist meant to abduct, ransom, pillage and steal from the people. Fill in periods of calm with trouble, giving work to guards.
Main points: 5 stat total, Journeyman skill for main weapons (Bow/crossbows get expert until bow draw time is rebalanced properly.)
Meant to be better statted then vanguard but same skill level. Vanguard has better starting gear, but bandits can earn much better gear more reliably, and get even more stats.
