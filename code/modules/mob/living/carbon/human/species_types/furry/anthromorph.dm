	<br><br> \ Their bloodlines were blessed by Dendor for their ancestor&#39;s devotion \
	and this is reflected in their appearance. Some descendants of the first Dendorite wild-kins, \
	especially those not as devoted to the ways of Dendor and filled \
	with wanderlust, emerged from their remote communities to embrace the civilization their ancestors had once rejected. \
	<br><br> \
	At first, they faced discrimination from people wary of their abnormal appearances. Yet, their appearance was a blessing \
	from Dendor, and the clergy of the Ten made this known throughout the lands of the faithful. Wild-kins are now fully \
	accepted, with many even holding titles of landed nobility. However, there is still an air of distrust and uncertainty \
	surrounding them, especially for those who acquired their features during life rather than through birth."
