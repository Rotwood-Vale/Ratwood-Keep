	Half-kins have an easier time being accepted into societies depending on what Beastling features \
	they have, but it is highly dependent on both their appearance and attitude. However, due to both \
	historic and ongoing discrimination of mixed bloods they are usually not fully accepted by either \
	of their parent races. Hence, Half-kins tend to share a strong sense of kinship with similar Half-kins. \
	Yet, their shared traits with respectable races do mean that Half-kins are more widely accepted into \
	societies that they share blood ties with than other Beastling races."
