	Drakians are a proud and ancient race that trace their heritage to dragons of old. \
	They are highly protective of their bloodline and do everything in their power to make sure it does not spread beyond their own, \
	as they believe themselves to be guardians of tradition and that it is their ultimate duty to maintain their prestige as a race. \
	After all, a single drop of draconic blood in one's bloodline means that they will experience all of the benefits of having draconic ancestors such as agelessness."

	They are highly protective of their bloodline and do everything in their power to make sure it does not spread beyond their own, \

	After all, a single drop of draconic blood in ones bloodline means that they will experience all of the benefits of having draconic ancestors such as agelessness.\
	<br><br> \
	Yet, it comes at a cost. \
	While initially viewed as one of the noblest races, \
	they are now hated for their insufferable arrogance and often appear completely out of touch with the rest of society. \
	Their inability to have a concept of time, refusal to compromise or intermarry, \
	along with their rejection of any technology that threatens their supremacy have earned them countless enemies from Axians to Dwarves. \
	For instance, they view any Wild-kin with draconic features or blood as inherently inferior. \
	Yet, not all Drakians are like this with some believing it is their duty to help lesser races, although many still view these Drakians to be just as insufferable.\
	<br><br> \
	In the past, Drakians held positions of power and prestige across all the realms. \
	Many try to style themselves after knight-philosophers in an attempt to hide their brutish ways. \
	When in reality, most Drakians are known for being bloody conquerors. \
	However, the rise of humans have caused their ambitions to crumble, forcing them to work with other races, especially at the climax of the Great Sissean Uprising. \
	Furthermore, dwindling numbers have caused Drakians to increasingly abandon the ways of old, forcing them to adapt to a more modern way of life."
