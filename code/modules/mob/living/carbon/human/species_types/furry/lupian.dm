	Lupians are the sons and daughters of Noc. They are a volf-like people hailing from the Northern Regions of the world. \
	They are resilient, cunning and fight ready creachures capable of surviving the north thanks to their rugged pelts, \
	sharp teeth and deep-rooted spirit of community. They are very dutiful individuals and make fantastic and fearsome \
	warriors to those who earn their loyalty. Thanks to their pack minded nature they are slow to trust the other races \
	but form deep connections with those they do. In recent years they have been driven from the forests by unrest and the \
	inevitable spread of the rot and pressed into cohabitation with races they'd deem lesser."
	expanded_desc = "Lupians live under elective monarchies, forms of feudalism where the king of a pack is chosen from, and by, the military council. \
	The leader of the pack is a philosopher king, a paragon of virtue and one who should inspire awe and loyalty among the population \
	while the real power is held by the military leadership. Should a king fail his people it is not uncommon for the entire kingdom \
	to fall into disarray as law and order begin to break down, for many Lupians see it a disgrace to themselves to follow a king who \
	appears weak. Similarly, most Lupians uphold an image of pride and toughness, it is only in the presence of someone who appears \
	stronger do they bend the knee. To become a leader is a constant challenge to maintain. \
	<br><br> \
	Vakran was once the largest of the pack-nations, the capital of Lupian civilization. After the King sequestered himself away under \
	insurmountable stress and went into hiding, it was revealed weeks later that he was poisoned by one of his sons. This plunged the \
	nation states under the Vakran name into chaos. Vassals left, either becoming free or aligning themselves with the neighboring \
	Frostfell or Felsaad, while others faced internal strife, civils wars between those who believed the Vakran name still held strong, \
	and those who saw the crown tainted, even the military council decimated itself between duels and the pitting of coups."
