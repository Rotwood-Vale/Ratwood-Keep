	A proud and robust race of short mountain folk, \
	the dwarves are known for their pride in martial strength \
	and the tenacity with which they adhere to their ancient traditions. \
	A Dwarf, much like the rock that they carve their fortresses out of, \
	is stubborn and ancient, with their race being the longest lived of all \
	of the Weeping God's creations. They, like stone, also rarely change \
	and tend to shun the modernization of the world around them. \
	Instead, a Dwarf looks to their ancestorial heritage for guidance on \
	the various challenges they face. Even if, ironically, this behaviour \
	leads their kind towards technological advacement as they continue \
	to improve their crafts, both in engineering workshops and the forges. \
	Dwarves are hearty, but are not known for their speed or eyesight... \
	Each dwarf hails from a ancient fortress named after the most plentiful mineral.<br>\
