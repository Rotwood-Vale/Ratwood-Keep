	\"Elf\" is a catch-all term used for tall, pointy-eared humanoids who can trace their \
	heritage to the ancient and mysterious Snow Elves. This species of elf, less frequently \
	seen, are also referred to by some as \"drow,\" and have several key differences \
	that set them apart from their more well-known and surface-dwelling kin. Chief among these \
	differences are their dark complexions and origins from the Underdark; a massive subterranean \
	landscape made up of a vast network of interconnected caves, caverns and tunnels. In this world \
	hidden deep beneath the soil are several dark elven cities who exist and function far from the \
	reaches of the rest of the surface-dwelling societies. These are a large part of what has earned \
	the dark elves their notoriety, for in these cities the worship of the ascendant pantheon is \
	normalized, and their cruel and bloodthirsty culture reflects this. It was rare to see dark \
	elves outside of their underground homes, but in recent years, more and more of them have fled \
	to the surface. The reasons for each dark elf fleeing the Underdark vary depending on the \
	individual, such as a kinder heart fleeing from a brutal society that scorns them for their \
	less cruel nature. However, not every dark elf seen on the surface can be safely assumed as \
	kind, for some leave the Underdark simply to find their own greater heights of power.<br>\

/*
	Former RT Desc: These guys were undead which doesn't really fit considering now you have a ton of them walking around.

	Descending from a perversion of necromancy, Dark Elves are a unique species \
	that have only recently found themselves a staple of daily life. \
	They boast a proud, beauty-centric culture that demands only the finest \
	out of its citizens, with anyone falling behind their cripplingly high standards \
	refered to as a Homonculus, while less graceful terms such as \
	Stitchface, Zombie or corpsewalker are most commonly thrown out by the elder races\
	Dark Elves tend to be extremely arrogant of others plights, with selfishness\
	being seen as a massive boon in their society. They are academic and usually well taught\
	through are noted to suffer from their biology, which tends to be weak and falls apart\
	without careful upkeep...\
	They typically trace their beginnings to how their progenator died before being raised."
