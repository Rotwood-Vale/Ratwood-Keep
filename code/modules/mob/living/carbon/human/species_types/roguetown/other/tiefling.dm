	Tieflings, also known as Infernal-Spawn by the Dwarves, are a relatively new species in Grimmoria\
	Having shown up sometime within the past two centuries, very little is known about their culture \
	as many seem to simply intergrate within whatever society they find themselves in. \
	Tieflings usually cause strong disturbances with their presence, as their fiendish looks \
	Many have claimed that they are the spawn of a succubus (Or incubus) laying with a mortal. \
	In this, their species has suffered vast tragedy throughout their short history, \
	Facing scrutiny, judgement and even genocide in the past. Wounding many tiefling psyche \
	and leading to most seeking a solitary life outside the watchful eyes of others. \
	Tiefling cannot reproduce with mortals, and so no half-breed exists. \
	Tiefling tend to be extremely perceptive and paranoid, as luck is rarely on their side \
	and their unique biology makes them extremely susceptible to injury."
