	Tieflings, also known as \"Infernal-Spawn\" by the Dwarves, are a relatively new species in the lands. \
	Having shown up sometime within the past two centuries, very little is known about their culture \
	as many seem to seamlessly intergrate into whatever society they find themselves in. \
	Despite this, Tieflings often cause strong disturbances wherever they go due to their fiendish appearances. \
	Many have claimed that they are the spawn of a succubus (Or incubus) laying with a mortal. \
	Due to this speculation, their species has suffered vast tragedy throughout their short history, \
	facing harsh scrutiny, unfair judgement, and even outright genocide in the worst cases. This history of brutal treatment and prejudce has resulted in the damage of many a Tiefling's psyche, causing to most of their kind to seek a solitary life away from the judgemental eyes of others. Tieflings cannot reproduce with mortals, and as a result no half-breed exists. Tieflings tend to be extremely perceptive and paranoid, as luck is rarely on their side, and their unique biology makes them extremely susceptible to injury.<br>\
