	info = {"<b>A quick guide for you to play Push Your Luck game!</b><br>
	First of all you need 6 dice with dots from 1 to 6 on them.<br>
	The game is turn based and your goal is to earn points by throwing dice.<br>
	<br>
	<i>Combinations of dice and points for them:</i><br>
	(1) - 100 points<br>
	(5) - 50 points<br>
	You can select multiple dice in one throw, i.e. if you select (1)(1)(5)(5) it will give you 100+100+50+50=300 points.<br>
	Three same dice multiplies dice result by 100, i.e.:<br>
	(2)(2)(2) = 200 points<br>
	(3)(3)(3) = 300 points, etc<br>
	but (1)(1)(1) = 1000 points<br>
	Every next same dice additionally multiplies result by 2, i.e.:<br>
	(5)(5)(5)(5) = 1000 points<br>
	(6)(6)(6)(6)(6) = 2400 points, etc<br>
	Three next combinations have constant points results.<br>
	(1)(2)(3)(4)(5) = 500 points<br>
	(2)(3)(4)(5)(6) = 750 points<br>
	(1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6) = 1500 points<br>
	<br>
	Only dice from same throw can create a combination.<br>
	After you make your throw and pick dices, you put them aside. You can then save your points and pass your turn or throw remaining dices again.<br>
	If your throw has no combinations, all your throw points gets nullified and you pass your throw.<br>
	If you manage to clear all your dice you start your next throw with 6 dice, but your points not saved untill you pass your turn.<br>
	First player to reach amount of points you set - wins!<br>

	<i>Have fun and push your luck to the limit!</i>
