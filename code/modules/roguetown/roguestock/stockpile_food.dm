// Withdraw Price used to be designed to match export price. 
// However this meant that food were often too expensive to buy as raw materials
// Now for food the withdraw price is set to be the same as the payout price
// Theoretically this does create a perverse incentive to export food instead of selling it locally
// But I live for the consequences of stewards deciding to neglect their local economy.
