### Config options added by Ratwood code.

## When players are funeralized, the default behavior is to prompt them to use the Underworld verb to respawn.
## When funeralized, spirits already in Underworld get teleported back to the start and their toll is set to paid.
## If this option is set, both behaviors will be foregone in favor of immediately sending funeralized bodies' players back to spawn.
## The force-respawning behavior will apply whether the players are connected or not, and respawn code will be called on mob login.
