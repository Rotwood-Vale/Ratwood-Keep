<u><b>Introduction:</b></u><br>
Herein lies the framework for justice within the realm. This tome shall serve as a guide for adjudicators in delivering equitable sentences, ensuring justice is achieved in the name of Ravox. The protections outlined within this tome do not extend to individuals classified as outlaws.<br><br>
Adjudicators shall consider the following factors when rendering a verdict and determining appropriate sentences: the nature of the offence, the accused's criminal history, their moral blameworthiness, how a reasonable person would have acted under similar circumstances, whom the offended party was, and any aggravating or mitigating factors.<br><br>
<u><b>Overview of Criminal Sanctions:</b></u><br>
<ol>
<li><b>Execution</b>: Shall be carried out by public beheading, burning, or hanging.</li>
<li><b>Enslavement</b>: Shall only be available for offences where it is specifically outlined.</li>
<li><b>Exile</b>: Duration of exile shall be determined based on the offence's severity.</li>
<li><b>Imprisonment</b>: Duration shall be dependent on the severity of the offence; imprisonment can be permanent in extreme cases.</li>
<li><b>Dismemberment</b>: Permanent removal of body parts as a punishment for severe crimes.</li>
<li><b>Maiming</b>: Severe injury that does not result in the loss of a limb or life.</li>
<li><b>Public Humiliation</b>: Public shaming or other forms of disgrace such as being locked in a public pillory for a duration of time.</li>
<li><b>Fines</b>: Payable to the Crown or to the noble of the land where the offence occurred. Failure to pay shall result in imprisonment or indentured servitude.</li>
<li><b>Damages</b>: Paid to the victim or their family. If the offender cannot pay, they shall be subjected to imprisonment or indentured servitude.</li>
</ol><br>
